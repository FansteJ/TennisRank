                <h2>ATP Rankings</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The PIF ATP Rankings (previously known as the Pepperstone ATP Rankings) are the merit-based method used
                by
                the
                Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the
                seeding
                of
                players in all singles and doubles tournaments. The first rankings for singles were published on 23
                August
                1973
                while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. Ranking points are awarded
                according
                to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, with the four Grand Slam
                tournaments
                awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after
                being
                awarded (with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the
                last
                ATP Tour event of the following year). Jannik Sinner is the current men's singles world No. 1.</p>

                <h3>ATP Race</h3>
                <p>The ATP Race is an annual performance-based points race to determine the qualifiers for the year-end
                    championship, in addition to the year-end No. 1 singles player and doubles team. The race, initially
                    called
                    the
                    "ATP Champions Race", was introduced by the ATP for the 2000 season as part of their "21st Century
                    Tennis"
                    strategy announced in 1999. All players and teams start the year with zero points, and accumulate
                    points
                    from tournament to tournament based on their performances. The player and team who end the season
                    with
                    the
                    most points are crowned as the year-end No. 1 in their disciplines, and the top-eight players and
                    teams
                    participate in the season-ending championship, the ATP Finals.</p>
