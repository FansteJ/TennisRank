        <h1>ATP Rankings</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The PIF ATP Rankings (previously known as the Pepperstone ATP Rankings) are the merit-based method used by
            the
            Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the seeding
            of
            players in all singles and doubles tournaments. The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August
            1973
            while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. Ranking points are awarded
            according
            to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, with the four Grand Slam tournaments
            awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being
            awarded (with the exception of the ATP Finals, from which points are dropped on the Monday following the
            last
            ATP Tour event of the following year). Jannik Sinner is the current men's singles world No. 1.</p>

            <h2>ATP Race</h2>
            <p>The ATP Race is an annual performance-based points race to determine the qualifiers for the year-end
                championship, in addition to the year-end No. 1 singles player and doubles team. The race, initially
                called
                the
                "ATP Champions Race", was introduced by the ATP for the 2000 season as part of their "21st Century
                Tennis"
                strategy announced in 1999. All players and teams start the year with zero points, and accumulate points
                from tournament to tournament based on their performances. The player and team who end the season with
                the
                most points are crowned as the year-end No. 1 in their disciplines, and the top-eight players and teams
                participate in the season-ending championship, the ATP Finals.</p>
